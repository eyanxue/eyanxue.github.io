Hi! I'm **Eyan Xue**, a Ph.D. student at Kyoto University — and a full-time **GOT7 fan**, part-time dendrite hunter, and full-time servant to my judgmental little **black-and-white cat** 🐄🐈‍⬛.

Science and K-pop might seem worlds apart, but to me, they’re both about **precision, structure, and unexpected beauty**. While my research dives into **time-resolved X-ray CT** scans and **machine learning** for solidification microstructures, my playlists are ruled by GOT7💚 — especially **Park Jinyoung & Mark Tuan**🍑.

And when GOT7 dropped a song called **“Python”**🐍?  
Yeah, I took that *very* personally.

> “Pig has dreams,” I say.  
> And some of those dreams involve clean CT segmentation, perfect model predictions, and a surprise Jinyoung solo drop at midnight.

My life is basically:
- 📊 Running simulations on Al-Cu alloys  
- 💻 Training neural networks to understand microstructure  
- 🐍 Writing thousands of lines of Python (the code and the song!)  
- 🐈‍⬛ Interpreting silent judgements from my monochrome cat overlord  
- 🎧 Looping *"Lullaby"*, *"DIVE"* & *"니가 하면"* until the GPU overheats  
- 📚 Reading papers by day, and watching dance practice videos by night  

In fact, my academic workflow looks suspiciously like this:

```python
while not_converged:
    train_model()
    plot_microstructure()
    stream("Python")  # by GOT7
```
